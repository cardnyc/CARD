<h1>Christian Action for Renewal &amp; Development</h1>
<p> Christian Action for Renewal &amp; Development (C.A.R.D) seeks to serve Seniors and Youth in the New York Metropolitan area through the development of Intergenerational Programs in the area of Affordable Housing, Health Care and Education. C.A.R.D is a not-for-profit corporation that seeks to promote continuing mission in the areas of Education, Health Care, Senior Services, Youth Services and Christian Music. </p>
 <p>In mid-1998, under the leadership of Bishop Stanley F. Thomas, a group of committed Christians met in Queens to determine how best to extend their ministry and mission to the people of the New York Metropolitan area.  Since then, the Organization has met regularly in its quest to achieve the aforementioned goals and is soliciting members of the Christian Community to be committed to this cause. </p>
